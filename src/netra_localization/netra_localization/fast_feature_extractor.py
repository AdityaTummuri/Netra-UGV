"""
NETRA-UGV FAST Corner Feature Extractor
=========================================
Grid-based FAST corner detection with adaptive thresholding.

Divides the frame into NxM cells and extracts the top-K strongest
FAST corners per cell to ensure uniform feature distribution across
the image, preventing feature clustering in textured regions.

Reference: MASTER_PROJECT_REPORT.md §3.3, TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md §2
  Uses ARM NEON-accelerated OpenCV FAST detector
  Execution: Sub-millisecond on ARM Cortex-A78AE
